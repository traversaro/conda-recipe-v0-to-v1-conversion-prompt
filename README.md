# conda-recipe-v0-to-v1-conversion-prompt

LLM-oriented prompt for conversion of conda recipe v0 to v1 (rattler-build format).

The only content of this repo is the [`conda-recipe-v0-to-v1-conversion-prompt.md`](./conda-recipe-v0-to-v1-conversion-prompt.md), that contains a prompt ready to be dropped in an LLM context, and can be helpful in case you want to ask an LLM to convert a conda recipe v0 to a conda recipe v1 (rattler-build format).
